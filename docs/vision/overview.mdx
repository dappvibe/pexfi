# The Case for Self-Custody

**Blockchain technology gave us the ability to be our own bank. Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) convinced us to give that power back.**

## The CEX Trap

For years, the industry has relied on Centralized Exchanges as the primary way to trade. We accepted this for convenience, but the cost has become too high.
CEXs have effectively recreated the traditional banking model on top of crypto rails:

- **Custodial Risk**: You don't own your assets; you own an IOU from a company.
- **Opaque Operations**: You cannot verify their solvency or their internal logic.
- **Gatekeeping**: They act as intermediaries that can freeze, block, or delay your access to your own wealth.

This is not why Bitcoin was invented. This is not why Ethereum was built.

## PEXFI: Returning to Utility

PEXFI is not a "rebellion" — it is a **correction**. It is a return to the functional utility of blockchain technology.

We use smart contracts to do exactly what they were designed for: **trustless coordination between two parties who don't know each other.**

### How We Differ

| Feature    | Centralized Exchange (CEX) | PEXFI (P2P Protocol)       |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Role**   | Intermediary & Custodian   | Neutral Infrastructure     |
| **Funds**  | They hold them             | Smart Contract holds them  |
| **Trust**  | Trust the company policy   | Trust the open-source code |
| **Access** | Permissioned               | Permissionless             |

## A Pragmatic Approach

We are building for users who value:

1.  **Security**: Eliminating the risk of exchange insolvency.
2.  **Sovereignty**: Ensuring 100% control over their own keys.
3.  **Reliability**: Using infrastructure that runs on decentralized networks (Arbitrum/Ethereum), not private servers.

We believe that in the long run, **non-custodial trading is not just an ideology—it is the safer, superior architectural choice.**

## The Economy of Ownership

PEXFI is designed to be owned and governed by the people who use it.
Instead of fees extracting value to a corporate balance sheet, the PEXFI protocol directs value back to the participants who provide liquidity and security.

**This is crypto trading, upgraded to its original standard.**
