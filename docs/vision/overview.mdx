# The Case for Self-Custody Trading

**Why the future of crypto is non-custodial, peer-to-peer marketplaces.**

## The Risks of Centralized Exchanges (CEXs)

For years, the crypto industry has relied on centralized intermediaries like Binance or Coinbase. However, relying on a CEX introduces significant "counterparty risk"—the risk that the exchange itself will fail, be hacked, or freeze your assets.

Key dangers of CEXs include:

- **Custodial Risk**: You don't own your crypto; you own an IOU. If the exchange becomes insolvent (like FTX), your funds are lost.
- **Account Freezes**: Centralized entities can arbitrarily lock your account or demand invasive documentation.
- **Data Breaches**: Storing personal data (KYC) on central servers makes you a target for identity theft.

## PEXFI: The Decentralized Alternative

PEXFI is a **Decentralized P2P Exchange** designed to eliminate these risks. By using **smart contract escrow**, we allow users to trade directly (peer-to-peer) without ever trusting a middleman.

### Comparison: CEX vs. P2P DEX

| Feature            | Centralized Exchange (CEX)       | PEXFI (P2P DEX)                         |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| **Asset Custody**  | Exchange holds funds (High Risk) | Smart Contract holds funds (No Risk)    |
| **Identity (KYC)** | Mandatory ID verification        | **No KYC required** (Wallet connection) |
| **Security Model** | Trust the Company                | **Trust the Code** (Auditable)          |
| **Settlement**     | Internal Database Update         | On-Chain Transaction                    |

## Why Self-Sovereignty Matters

We are building for the "sovereign individual"—traders who value:

1.  **Financial Privacy**: Protecting your transaction history and identity.
2.  **Asset Security**: Eliminating the possibility of exchange runs or insolvency.
3.  **Censorship Resistance**: Ensuring that no central authority can block your ability to trade.

**PEXFI is the secure, non-custodial solution for fiat-to-crypto trading.**
