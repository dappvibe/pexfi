# Vision & Philosophy

PEXFI exists to bring crypto back to its roots — peer-to-peer, censorship-resistant, and truly decentralized.

## The Problem

Today's crypto trading happens on centralized exchanges. These platforms:

- **Freeze accounts** without warning
- **Demand identity documents** for basic access
- **Block users** by geography
- **Comply with censorship** requests

They control who can access crypto, when, and how — turning what should be a borderless tool into a gated system.

<Note>
  Having your crypto on a centralized exchange is contrary to the original vision of peer-to-peer electronic cash.
</Note>

## The Solution

PEXFI is a decentralized, peer-to-peer marketplace where users trade directly:

- **No company holds your funds**
- **No KYC required**
- **Smart contract escrows** protect every trade
- **You stay in control** of your keys and privacy
