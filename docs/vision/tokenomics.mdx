# PEXFI Tokenomics

**A sustainable, deflationary token model for the decentralized exchange economy.**

The PEXFI token ($PEXFI) is the native utility and governance token of the PEXFI marketplace. It creates a **circular economy** where platform growth directly benefits token holders through yield and scarcity.

## Deflationary Economic Model

PEXFI employs a **Buyback and Burn** mechanism to link trading volume with token value. Unlike inflationary tokens, PEXFI is designed to become scarcer over time.
