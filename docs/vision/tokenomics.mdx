## Fee Model

### Trading Fees

| Payment Method            | Fee Per Side |
| ------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Pay with PEXFI**        | 0.25%        |
| **Pay with other tokens** | 0.50%        |

<Note>Paying fees in PEXFI gives you a 50% discount.</Note>

### Automatic Conversion

When fees are paid in other tokens, the platform swaps them to PEXFI on a DEX. This creates **consistent buy pressure** as trading volume grows.

## Treasury

All fees flow into the Treasury contract and are allocated:

| Fund               | Allocation | Purpose                              |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Staker Rewards** | 50%        | Arbitration and staking payouts      |
| **Protocol Fund**  | 40%        | Development, marketing, integrations |
| **Operations**     | 10%        | Audits, support, infrastructure      |
