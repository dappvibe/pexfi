# Market Opportunity

The peer-to-peer crypto trading market shows strong demand, especially in regions with limited banking access or high remittance needs.

## Market Size

Legacy P2P platforms demonstrated significant demand:

| Platform      | Peak Volume | Revenue       |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| LocalBitcoins | ~$2B/year   | ~$25M/year    |
| Paxful        | ~$1.6B/year | ~$15-20M/year |
| Remitano      | ~$3B/year   | Undisclosed   |

Combined, these platforms processed billions in annual volume with tens of millions in revenue.

## What Happened to Competitors

    Custodial with strict KYC. Shut down in 2023 under regulatory pressure.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Paxful" icon="xmark">
    Global reach but custodial escrow. Suspended operations in 2023 due to compliance challenges.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Noones" icon="lock">
    Custodial P2P platform. Suffered a $7.9M hack in 2025 via bridge exploit. Partial decentralization can still be
    exploited.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="RoboSats" icon="robot">
    Bitcoin/Lightning P2P via Tor. No KYC but Bitcoin-only, technical UX, no fiat dispute mediation.

  <Accordion title="Bisq" icon="desktop">
    Desktop-only, multichain P2P. Uses bonded arbitrators but complex UX, slow trades, limited fiat options.

## The Gap

Legacy platforms either:

- **Shut down** under regulatory pressure
- **Impose KYC** defeating the purpose
- **Suffer hacks** due to centralized custody
- **Provide poor UX** limiting adoption

<Note>
  PEXFI's fully non-custodial, open-source, no-KYC model fills the gap for censorship-resistant, privacy-focused fiat
  ramps.
</Note>

## Target Users

### Primary Markets

- **Underbanked regions** — Latin America, Africa, Southeast Asia
- **Remittance corridors** — Cross-border money movement
- **Privacy-conscious traders** — Avoiding surveillance

### Use Cases

- Converting crypto earnings to local currency
- Buying crypto without bank involvement
- Cross-border value transfer
- Building P2P trading businesses

## Why Now

Several trends make this the right time:

1. **CEX failures** — FTX, regulatory crackdowns eroding trust
2. **Rising awareness** — Users want self-custody
3. **Mature infrastructure** — L2s, IPFS, better wallets
4. **Regulatory clarity** — Non-custodial software is different from exchanges
