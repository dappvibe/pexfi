# PEXFI Strategic Roadmap

**Our path to building the world's most secure decentralized P2P exchange.**

We are executing a phased deployment to ensure security, liquidity, and adoption.

## Phase 1: Protocol Launch (Q2 2025)

_Laying the Foundation for Decentralized Trading._

- **Smart Contract Deployment**: Launching audited escrow contracts on Ethereum Mainnet.
- **Liquidity Bootstrapping**: Establishing initial $PEXFI liquidity pools on Uniswap.
- **Public Beta Access**: Opening the platform for permissionless P2P trading.

## Phase 2: Ecosystem Growth (Q3 2025)

_Expanding Global Access and Utility._

- **Global Payment Rails**: Integration of diverse fiat payment methods (Bank Transfer, SEPA, UPI).
- **P2P Merchant Program**: Launching the Ambassador and Affiliate program for local liquidity providers.
- **Reputation V1**: Activation of Soulbound Reputation Tokens (SBT) for trader verification.

## Phase 3: Scaling (Q4 2025)

_Enhancing Liquidity and Features._

- **Top Tier CEX/DEX Listings**: Expanding token accessibility on major exchanges.
- **Staking Rewards Live**: Activation of the revenue-sharing staking contract.
- **Decentralized Arbitration**: Moving dispute resolution to a community-governed DAO model.
- **Cross-Chain Support**: Deploying PEXFI on additional EVM networks (Optimism, Polygon).

## Phase 4: Full DAO Sovereignty (2026+)

_Achieving Complete Protocol Decentralization._
