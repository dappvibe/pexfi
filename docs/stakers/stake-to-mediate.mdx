# Stake to Mediate (Proposed)

**Turn your PEXFI tokens into a tool for justice and yield.**

The "Stake to Mediate" model is a proposed DAO mechanism that decentralizes the arbitration process. Instead of a centralized support team, community members can stake tokens to become qualified Arbitrators.

## How It Works

1.  **Stake PEXFI**: Users lock a required amount of $PEXFI tokens into the Arbitration Contract.
2.  **Earn Qualification**: Staking grants the "Arbitrator" status, allowing the user to view and resolve disputed trades.
3.  **Resolve Disputes**: When a trade is disputed, it is randomly assigned to a pool of staked Arbitrators.
4.  **Earn Fees**: Successful resolution of a dispute rewards the Arbitrator with a portion of the trade fee.
5.  **Slashing Conditions**: Malicious or negligent arbitrators risk losing a portion of their stake (slashing) if their decision is overturned by a higher-tier appeal.

## Why Stake?

- **Real Yield**: Earn active income from platform fees.
- **Governance Power**: Arbitrators have a higher weight in DAO voting.
- **Ecosystem Security**: Help keep the platform safe and fair for everyone.

<Note>
  This feature is currently in the **Proposal** phase. Exact staking amounts and slashing parameters will be determined
  by community vote.
