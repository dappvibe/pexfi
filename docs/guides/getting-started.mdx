## Step 3: Your First Trade

### Buying Crypto

1. Find a **Sell Offer** that suits your price and limits.
2. Click **Buy** and enter the amount of fiat you want to spend.
3. **Initiate the trade**. This creates a request.

5. Once funded, **send the fiat payment** using the details provided.
6. Click **Mark as Paid** in the deal interface.
7. Wait for the seller to confirm receipt. The crypto will be released to your wallet.

### Selling Crypto

1. Create a **Sell Offer** or accept a **Buy Request**.
2. When a trade starts, **deposit the crypto** into the secure escrow smart contract.
3. Wait for the buyer to mark the trade as paid.
4. **Verify receipt** of funds in your bank account/payment app.
5. Click **Release Funds** to unlock the crypto for the buyer.

## Safety Tips

<Warning>
  **Always keep communication within the PEXFI platform.** Off-chain messages (Telegram, WhatsApp) are not verifiable and cannot be used in dispute resolution.
</Warning>

- **Verify Payment First**: Never release crypto until you see the money in your bank account. Screenshots can be faked.
- **Start Small**: Build trust with small amounts before making large trades.
- **Check Reputation**: Trade with verified users or those with established history.
- **Document Everything**: Keep all conversation and evidence of payment within the deal chat.
