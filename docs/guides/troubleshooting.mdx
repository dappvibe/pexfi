# Troubleshooting Guide

Solutions to common problems encountered while using PEXFI.

## Connection Issues

### I can't connect my wallet

1. **Refresh the page**: Sometimes the connection request times out.
2. **Check your network**: Ensure your wallet is set to **Arbitrum One**. PEXFI does not support Ethereum Mainnet or other chains yet.
3. **Clear cache**: If using MetaMask, try clearing your browser cache or disconnecting the site in wallet settings and reconnecting.
4. **Mobile users**: Use the "WalletConnect" option and scan the QR code, or use the in-app browser of your wallet.

### "Wrong Network" Error

PEXFI runs on Arbitrum One.

- Open your wallet extension.
- Switch the network to **Arbitrum One**.
- If you don't have it added, visit [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org) to add it automatically.

## Trading Issues

### "Transaction Failed"

- **Insufficient ETH for Gas**: You need a small amount of ETH on Arbitrum to pay for network fees, even if you are trading USDT.
- **Slippage/Price Change**: If the market is volatile, the price might have moved. Try refreshing.
- **Contract Paused**: In rare maintenance events, contracts might be paused. Check official announcements.

### I accepted a deal but don't see the chat

- It may take a few seconds for the deal to be indexed. Wait 10-30 seconds and refresh the "My Deals" page.
- Ensure your transaction to accept the deal was confirmed on the blockchain.

## Payment & escrow

### I paid but the seller hasn't released

1. **Mark as Paid**: Ensure you clicked the "Mark as Paid" button in the deal interface.
2. **Message the Seller**: Send a friendly reminder in the deal chat.
3. **Wait**: Sellers differ in response time.
4. **Open Dispute**: If the seller is unresponsive for a significant time (e.g., > 1 hour for instant methods) or refuses to release, click "Open Dispute".

### Buyer marked as paid but I see no money

1. **Check your Bank/App**: Log in to your bank or payment app directly. Do not trust screenshots sent in chat.
2. **Do NOT Release**: Never release crypto until you see the funds in your own available balance.
3. **Ask for details**: Ask the buyer for the transaction reference in the chat.
4. **Open Dispute**: If the buyer insists they paid but you haven't received it after a reasonable time, open a dispute.
