# On-Chain Reputation

**Trust is the currency of peer-to-peer trade. PEXFI makes it verifiable.**

In a decentralized environment where users are anonymous, reputation is critical. PEXFI introduces a **Soulbound Token (RepToken)** system that allows traders to build a permanent, unforgeable history of reliability.

## The RepToken Standard

Traditional reviews are stored on a company's private server and can be deleted or manipulated. PEXFI reputation is different:

- **Immutable**: Your trading history is written to the blockchain.
- **Portable**: Because it is an on-chain asset, your reputation belongs to you and can be verified by anyone.
- **Soulbound**: It is mathematically bound to your wallet address and cannot be transferred or sold.

## Ranking System

The platform recognizes and rewards consistent performance through a tiered system.

## The Value of Reputation

A high Reputation Score is a valuable business asset on PEXFI:

1.  **Priority Visibility**: High-ranking traders appear first in search results.
2.  **Fee Discounts**: Proven reliability is rewarded with lower platform costs.
3.  **Counterparty Confidence**: Buyers prefer trading with established merchants, allowing for faster settlement.

**Build a reputation that you—not a platform—truly own.**
