# Reputation System

PEXFI uses a non-transferable NFT to track your trading history and build trust in the marketplace.

## Reputation NFT

When you complete your first trade, you receive a **Reputation NFT** (RepToken):

- Bound to your wallet address forever
- Cannot be transferred or sold
- Automatically updated after each trade
- Visible to all other traders

<Note>Your reputation follows your wallet. Trading from a new wallet means starting fresh.</Note>

## What's Tracked

| Metric              | Description                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Trade Count**     | Total number of completed trades      |
| **Trade Volume**    | Cumulative value of all trades        |
| **Completion Rate** | Percentage of successful trades       |
| **Dispute Rate**    | How often your trades end in disputes |
| **Response Time**   | Average time to respond to deals      |

## Building Reputation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Complete Trades">Every successful trade improves your score</Step>
  <Step title="Respond Quickly">Fast responses boost your ranking</Step>
  <Step title="Avoid Disputes">Clean trades matter more than volume</Step>
  <Step title="Leave Reviews">Earn fee refunds by providing feedback</Step>
</Steps>

## Anti-Gaming Measures

PEXFI uses several techniques to prevent reputation manipulation:

- **Volume-weighted scoring** — Small trades don't boost rank as much
- **Time-weighted history** — Recent activity matters more
- **Graph analysis** — Detecting suspicious trading patterns
- **Sybil detection** — Identifying fake wallet networks

<Warning>Attempting to artificially inflate your reputation may result in account flagging.</Warning>
