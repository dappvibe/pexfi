# Offers

An offer is your public advertisement on the PEXFI marketplace. It defines what you want to trade, at what price, and under what conditions.

## What is an Offer?

When you create an offer, you are essentially deploying a smart contract interaction that:

- Specifies the **token** you're trading (e.g., USDT, USDC)
- Sets your **price** in fiat currency
- Defines **trade limits** (minimum and maximum amounts)
- Lists accepted **payment methods**

<Note>Each offer is managed by you. You have full control to modify or remove it at any time.</Note>

## Offer Types

  <Card title="Sell Offer" icon="arrow-up-from-bracket">
    **You have crypto** and want to receive fiat payment. You are the "maker" selling digital assets.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Buy Offer" icon="arrow-down-to-bracket">
    **You have fiat** and want to purchase crypto. You are the "maker" looking to buy digital assets.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Offer Parameters

When creating an offer, you will configure the following:

| Parameter           | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Token**           | The cryptocurrency you are looking to buy or sell (e.g., USDT).             |
| **Fiat Currency**   | The local currency you want to use for the trade (e.g., USD, EUR, INR).     |
| **Price**           | Your exchange rate. Can be fixed or dynamic based on market price.          |
| **Limits**          | The minimum and maximum amount of fiat you are willing to trade per deal.   |
| **Payment Methods** | How you want to pay or get paid (e.g., Bank Transfer, Wise, Revolut).       |
| **Terms**           | Any specific instructions or requirements for the counterparty.             |

## Creating an Offer

1. **Connect your wallet** to PEXFI.
2. Navigate to **My Offers** and click **Create Offer**.
3. **Select the token** and **fiat currency**.
4. **Set your price** and **trading limits**.
5. **Add accepted payment methods**.
6. **Review details** and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

<Warning>Creating an offer involves a blockchain transaction. Ensure you have a small amount of ETH (on Arbitrum) to cover gas fees.</Warning>

## Managing Offers

Once your offer is live, you can manage it from the dashboard:

- **Pause/Resume**: Temporarily hide your offer from the marketplace without deleting it. Useful if you're away.
- **Edit**: Update price, limits, or payment methods to stay competitive.
- **Delete**: Remove the offer permanently from the registry.

## Maximizing Visibility

Your offers compete with others in the marketplace. To get more trades:

- **Competitive Pricing**: Ensure your rates are in line with or better than the market.
- **High Reputation**: Complete trades successfully to build your score. Higher rated traders rank first.
- **Fast Response**: Be active and respond quickly to trade requests.
- **Clear Terms**: detailed and friendly terms attract more users.
