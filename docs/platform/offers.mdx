# Offers

An offer is your public listing on the PEXFI marketplace. It defines what you want to trade, at what price, and under what conditions.

## What is an Offer?

When you create an offer, you deploy a smart contract that:

- Specifies the **token** you're trading (e.g., USDT, USDC)
- Sets your **price** in fiat currency
- Defines **trade limits** (minimum and maximum amounts)
- Lists accepted **payment methods**

<Note>Each offer is a separate smart contract owned by you. Only you can modify or delete it.</Note>
