# Crypto As It Was Meant To Be

**CEXs have become the very thing crypto was built to replace.**

They hold your keys. They decide if you can transact. They are the new banks.
PEXFI returns to the original vision of blockchain: **Users trading directly with users, with no intermediary holding the funds.**

## The Problem with Centralized Exchanges

We blindly trusted CEXs to be our gateways, but they quietly became the new gatekeepers.

  <Accordion title="They Are The New Custodians" icon="building-columns">
    "Not your keys, not your coins" isn't a slogan; it's a reality. When you use a CEX, you are asking permission to
    move your own assets.

  <Accordion title="Centralized Points of Failure" icon="server">
    From hacks to insolvencies, history has shown that pooling billions in one wallet is a dangerous design flaw.

    They decide who trades based on changing policies, not protocol rules. PEXFI is neutral infrastructure.

## The PEXFI Solution

We don't need a better bank. We need to stop using banks for crypto.

- **Non-Custodial Escrow**: Funds are locked in a smart contract, not a corporate wallet.
- **Direct Settlement**: Assets settle directly to your self-custody wallet.
- **Verifiable Reputation**: Trust is built on-chain and belongs to you, not a proprietary database.

**Take back control of your financial interactions.**
