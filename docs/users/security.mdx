# Security & Trust

PEXFI is designed with security as a core principle — from smart contract architecture to fraud prevention.

## Security Model

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Open Source" icon="code-branch">
    All smart contracts and frontend publicly verifiable
  </Card>
  <Card title="Non-Custodial" icon="key">
    Users hold their own funds at all times
  </Card>
  <Card title="Auditable" icon="magnifying-glass">
    On-chain transactions create permanent audit trail
  </Card>
  <Card title="Privacy by Design" icon="user-shield">
    No user data collected or stored
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Smart Contract Security

- **Battle-tested patterns** — Built on OpenZeppelin contracts
- **Minimal privilege** — Arbitrators can only route funds to participants
- **Immutable escrow** — Contract logic cannot be changed after deployment
- **Transparent operations** — All actions verifiable on-chain

## Fraud Mitigation

### Payment Fraud

| Threat              | Mitigation                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Fake payments       | Require proof before release   |
| Reversible payments | Encourage irreversible methods |
| Wrong amounts       | Verify exact amounts in chat   |

### Non-Release Attacks

| Threat              | Mitigation                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Seller holds crypto | Escrow + arbitrator enforcement |
| Buyer stalls        | Time-based dispute escalation   |

### Platform Attacks

| Threat               | Mitigation                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Arbitrator collusion | Manual vetting, future DAO slashing        |
| Sybil attacks        | Volume-weighted reputation, graph analysis |
| Spam/DoS             | Small fees to post, rate limits            |

## Identity Protection

<Warning>
  PEXFI never collects personal information. This protects both users and the platform from data breach liability.
</Warning>

- **Wallet-only identity** — No accounts, just addresses
- **No KYC data** — Nothing to leak or subpoena
- **On-chain reputation** — Trust based on verifiable history
- **In-app messaging** — No external communication required

## Resilient Access

The PEXFI interface is designed to resist censorship:

- **IPFS hosting** — Decentralized content delivery
- **Multiple gateways** — Fallback access points
- **Direct contracts** — Users can interact directly with smart contracts
- **Open frontend** — Anyone can host their own interface

## Dispute Fairness

The dispute system is designed for impartiality:

1. **Evidence-based** — Decisions rely on documented proof
2. **On-chain record** — All messages preserved
3. **Limited powers** — Arbitrators cannot redirect funds elsewhere
4. **Reputation stakes** — Arbitrators have skin in the game

## Future Enhancements
