# Trading Guide

On PEXFI, you can trade in two ways:

1.  **Browse Offers**: Find an existing ad and reply to it (Fastest).
2.  **Create Offer**: Post your own ad with your specific price and terms (Custom).

Regardless of how you start, **every deal is secured by a Smart Contract.**

---

## Scenario A: Browse Offers (Taker)

Use this method if you want to complete a trade immediately.

### 1. Find a Match

Go to the **Marketplace** and use filters:

- **I want to**: Buy or Sell.
- **Currency**: USD, EUR, etc.
- **Method**: Bank Transfer, Wise, etc.

### 2. Check Reputation

Before clicking accept, look at the trader's history. High completion rates (95%+) indicate reliability.

### 3. Accept Offer

Enter the amount you want to trade and click **Start Deal**. This deploys the Smart Contract.

---

## Scenario B: Post an Offer (Maker)

Use this method if you want to set your own price (e.g., 2% above market) or use a specific payment method not listed.

### 1. Create Offer

Go to **My Deals** > **Create Offer**.

- **Set Price**: Fixed or Dynamic (e.g., Market Price + 2%).
- **Set Limits**: Minimum and maximum trade sizes.

### 2. Publish

Your offer is now live. **You do not need to deposit funds yet.**

- You keep custody of your funds until someone accepts your offer.

## Executing the Deal

Once a deal is matched (via Scenario A or B), follow these 3 secure steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Funding the Escrow">
    **If you are the Seller**: You must deposit crypto into the **Smart Contract Escrow**. **If you are the Buyer**:
    Wait until the status says **Funded**. Never send money before this.
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Making Payment">
    **Buyer**: Send fiat directly to the seller (e.g., via Bank App). Mark as "Paid" in PEXFI only after sending.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Releasing Funds">
    **Seller**: Check your bank account. Once confirmed, click **Release**. The Smart Contract sends crypto to the
    Buyer.
  </Step>
</Steps>
