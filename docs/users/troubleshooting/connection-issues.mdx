## Connection Issues

### I can't connect my wallet

1. **Refresh the page**: Sometimes the connection request times out.
2. **Check your network**: Ensure your wallet is set to **Ethereum**. PEXFI does not support Ethereum Mainnet or other chains yet.
3. **Clear cache**: If using MetaMask, try clearing your browser cache or disconnecting the site in wallet settings and reconnecting.
4. **Mobile users**: Use the "WalletConnect" option and scan the QR code, or use the in-app browser of your wallet.

### "Wrong Network" Error

PEXFI runs on Ethereum.

- Open your wallet extension.
- Switch the network to **Ethereum**.
- If you don't have it added, visit [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org) to add it automatically.
