## Trading Issues

### "Transaction Failed"

- **Insufficient ETH for Gas**: You need a small amount of ETH on Arbitrum to pay for network fees, even if you are trading USDT.
- **Slippage/Price Change**: If the market is volatile, the price might have moved. Try refreshing.
- **Contract Paused**: In rare maintenance events, contracts might be paused. Check official announcements.

### I accepted a deal but don't see the chat

- It may take a few seconds for the deal to be indexed. Wait 10-30 seconds and refresh the "My Deals" page.
- Ensure your transaction to accept the deal was confirmed on the blockchain.
