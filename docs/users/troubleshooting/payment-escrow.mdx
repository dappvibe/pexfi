## Payment & escrow

### I paid but the seller hasn't released

1. **Mark as Paid**: Ensure you clicked the "Mark as Paid" button in the deal interface.
2. **Message the Seller**: Send a friendly reminder in the deal chat.
3. **Wait**: Sellers differ in response time.
4. **Open Dispute**: If the seller is unresponsive for a significant time (e.g., > 1 hour for instant methods) or refuses to release, click "Open Dispute".

### Buyer marked as paid but I see no money

1. **Check your Bank/App**: Log in to your bank or payment app directly. Do not trust screenshots sent in chat.
2. **Do NOT Release**: Never release crypto until you see the funds in your own available balance.
3. **Ask for details**: Ask the buyer for the transaction reference in the chat.
4. **Open Dispute**: If the buyer insists they paid but you haven't received it after a reasonable time, open a dispute.
