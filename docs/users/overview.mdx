# The Exchange You Can Carry on a USB Stick

**They can seize a domain name. They can’t seize a file in your pocket.**

Unlike centralized exchanges that can kick you out anytime or legacy P2P sites that get shut down, PEXFI is different.
We **don't hold your funds**, and we don't have a server to shut down. We are just a window to the Ethereum blockchain. You maintain **100% control** of your funds.

**Website down? Domain blocked? No problem...** Just open the Local Copy on your computer. As long as you have the file, you own the exchange.

## The Problem with CEXs

Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) are just new banks. They:

- ❌ Hold custody of your keys.
- ❌ Restrict access as they pleased.
- ❌ Report your holdings and transactions to authorities.
- ❌ Can be hacked or go bankrupt, losing your funds.

**PEXFI is different.** We provide the code; you own the exchange.

## How It Works

1.  **Match**: Find an offer or create your own.
2.  **Smart Escrow**: Seller deposits crypto into the **Smart Contract**.
3.  **Pay**: Buyer sends fiat directly to the seller (e.g., Bank Transfer).
4.  **Auto-Release**: Seller checks their bank, confirms, and the contract releases funds to the user.
5. **Disputes** are resolved by DAO. Mediators fairness is ensured by staking.
