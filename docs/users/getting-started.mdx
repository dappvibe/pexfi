## Step 3: Trading Overview

### Buying Crypto

- **Find an Offer**: Browse the list and filter by your preferred currency and payment method.
- **Start Deal**: When you create a deal, the Seller deposits crypto into the **Smart Contract Escrow**.
- **Pay Seller**: Send the fiat amount directly to the seller using the agreed payment method.
- **Receive Funds**: Once the seller confirms payment, the smart contract releases the crypto to your wallet.

### Selling Crypto

- **Create Offer**: Set your price and terms.
- **Fund Escrow**: When a buyer initiates a deal, you must deposit the crypto into the Smart Contract.
- **Verify Payment**: Wait until you see the funds in your bank account.
- **Release**: Confirm receipt to release the crypto to the buyer.

<Warning>
  **Security Note:** Never release crypto until you have confirmed receipt of funds in your own banking application.
  Screenshots provided by buyers can be forged.
</Warning>
