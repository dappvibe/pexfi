# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is PEXFI?">
    PEXFI is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto exchange. It allows users to trade cryptocurrency directly with each other using smart contracts for escrow, without a centralized intermediary holding funds.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need to complete KYC?">
  No. PEXFI is a non-custodial decentralized application (dApp). You connect with your Web3 wallet (like MetaMask). We
  do not collect personal data like passports or ID cards.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is PEXFI safe?">
  PEXFI uses smart contract escrow to secure trades. Funds are locked on the blockchain until the trade is completed.
  This eliminates the risk of the exchange running away with your funds. However, like all P2P trading, you should be
  cautious of scammers and always verify payment receipt before releasing funds.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if the website is shut down?">
  Nothing happens to your money. PEXFI is designed to be **Unstoppable**. The website you are using is just a window to
  the blockchain. You can download the **Local Copy** (an HTML file) and run it directly from your computer. Even if the
  domain is seized, your Local Copy connects directly to Ethereum, allowing you to trade and withdraw funds anytime. We
  built a backdoor for _you_, not for regulators. 💾
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What networks does PEXFI support?">
    Ethereum. Layer 2 networks are coming soon!

## Trading & Fees

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are the fees?">
    PEXFI charges a small protocol fee (e.g., 0.3%) on completed trades. The specific fee is displayed before you accept or create an offer. Gas fees (network fees) are paid directly to the Ethereum network.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long do trades take?">
  This depends on the payment method. Bank transfers might take hours or days, while instant payment methods settle in
  minutes. Once payment is confirmed, the crypto release is instant via the smart contract.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if the other party doesn't respond?">
    If a trade is inactive or one party becomes unresponsive, you can open a dispute. An arbitrator will review the case and the chat history to resolve the issue.
