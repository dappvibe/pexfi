# Accessing PEXFI

**PEXFI is a Web3-native protocol. Your wallet is your identity.**

We prioritize **self-custody**, meaning you retain absolute control over your assets at all times. We do not store passwords, emails, or personal data.

## Option 1: Self-Custody (Recommended)

For maximum security and sovereignty, we recommend connecting directly with your own Web3 wallet.

### Supported Wallets

- **MetaMask** (Browser Extension & Mobile)
- **Rabby** (Optimized for security)
- **WalletConnect** (Connect any mobile wallet)
- **Hardware Wallets** (Ledger/Trezor via generic interfaces)

### How to Connect

1.  Click the **Connect Wallet** button in the top right.
2.  Select your provider.
3.  Sign the secure prompt on your device.

<Note>
  **Security Tip**: PEXFI will *never* ask for your seed phrase. All transactions require your explicit approval.
</Note>

## Option 2: Smart Wallet (Ease of Use)

For users who are new to crypto or prefer a simplified experience, PEXFI offers a **Smart Wallet** solution.

**What is it?**
A Smart Wallet is a contract-based account that abstracts away some complexities of key management while maintaining partial self-custody principles.

**How it works:**

- **Creation**: We deploy a smart contract wallet for you associated with your social login (email/Google).
- **Funding**: To execute transactions, you must deposit a small amount of crypto (ETH or any supported token) to the wallet address to cover network gas fees.
- **Routing**: You input commands via the UI, and the wallet executes them.
- **Auto-Forwarding**: Configure automatic forwarding of settled funds to a "Cold Storage" address.

<Warning>
  While Smart Wallets offer convenience, they rely on account abstraction layers. For strictly sovereign usage, Option 1
  is superior.
</Warning>

## Why No Username/Password?

Traditional accounts are insecure.

- Passwords are stolen.
- Databases are hacked.
- Admins can lock you out.

By using cryptography (keys), **you are the only person on Earth** who can authorize a trade from your account. PEXFI cannot freeze you out because we do not hold your keys.
