# Verifiable On-Chain Reputation

**Building trust in a decentralized, anonymous marketplace.**

PEXFI solves the problem of trust in P2P trading with a revolutionary **Soulbound Token (RepToken)** system. This creates a permanent, verifiable trading history on the blockchain.

## What is a Soulbound Reputation Token?

Unlike centralized review systems (like Trustpilot or eBay feedback) that can be deleted or manipulated by the platform, **PEXFI Reputation** is:

- **On-Chain**: Every completed trade and review is recorded on the blockchain.
- **Immutable**: Your history cannot be altered or censored by anyone.
- **Portable**: You own your reputation. It is bound to your wallet address and can be verified by any dApp.

## Reputation Tiers and Benefits

Traders earn higher status by executing successful, dispute-free trades.
